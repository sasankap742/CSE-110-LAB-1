            <p> There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

            <p> Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

            <div class="one">One As long as you save the .html and .css files in your editor after you make changes, you can refresh the browser view of your .html file to see your updates (you might need to clear your cache and refresh if you’re not seeing changes update). When all is said and done, try to play around with your specific CSS styles (including the margins/padding) to closely match this example (2 screenshots) below:

                For example, we might want to have the same class for all of the headings in the body of a webpage, such that if we decide we want to change the size, color, and font of the headings, we can change all of them (and potential future headings we create) at once in our CSS style for that class. We would only want to specify and style an id if we knew for sure that there would only be ONE element with that id, such as a target section for a specific anchor link, or a one-off image which needs unique styling. id is also more specific than class, so its style would take precedence over the class of an element in the CSS cascade; this could be useful if you want to uniquely adjust certain CSS for a heading (such as make it invisible) but otherwise want it to conform to CSS styles for the heading class.

            <div class="three">Three So why are CSS stylesheets “cascading”? This is to ensure a definitive, consistent style if there are multiple style references to the same HTML element. You can think of it like the order of operations in mathematics (i.e. calculate exponents before multiplying, multiply before adding, etc.). For example, HTML elements have some default styles, but the CSS that you as a developer specify takes precedence, and any inline CSS that’s more specific to one element takes precedence over your attached stylesheet for multiple elements, and any CSS you designate with an !important takes precedence over pretty much everything. In the “Styles” tab of the inspector tool, you can see the style references for an element – note how the color attributes in the example below are crossed out, since the specified colors at the top took precedence over those styles. If you’re interested in learning more about this concept of cascades, feel free to refer to this documentation.

            <div class="four">Four All this to say that these concepts will probably make more sense as you see them in practice, so don’t worry if the linked documentation is still confusing for you! Web developers are excellent at learning by trial-and-error, as well as learning from others’ code. In order to help with that, modern browsers have browser developer tools, AKA inspector tools, (usually Right click > “Inspect” in the browser) to see the internal HTML/CSS as well as JavaScript and media sources used for any element on any web page. You can also change the HTML/CSS directly on the inspector to see the effect of these changes on the screen.
